Perfect. Here's a CHRO dashboard business logic write-up in the same structured style:

---

**PHASE 3: BUSINESS LOGIC DEFINITION – CHRO Persona**

**CHRO Focus Areas Recap:**

* Talent Acquisition & Retention
* Workforce Productivity
* Learning & Development
* Employee Engagement
* Diversity & Inclusion
* HR Cost Efficiency
* Compliance & Risk

**Industry Context:** Mid-to-large enterprises across industries with centralized HRMS (SAP SuccessFactors, Workday, Dynamics HR).
**Company Size:** 1K–10K employees.
**Time Horizon:** 2 years historical data.
**Fiscal Year:** Jan–Dec (configurable).

---

**1. Seasonality Patterns: HR Workflows Over Time**

* **Hiring Trends:** Peaks in Q1 & Q3 (annual plans, post-midyear budget resets). Slower hiring in Q4.
* **Attrition Trends:** Higher in Q2 & Q4 (annual appraisal cycles, job switching season).
* **Leave Utilization:** Spikes in Q4 (holidays, year-end burn), and Q2 (summer).
* **Learning Initiatives:** Quarterly bursts tied to OKRs. New employee training aligns with onboarding spikes.
* **Performance Reviews:** Bi-annual (Q2 & Q4), with related goal updates and ratings.

---

**2. HR Transaction Flows: The Lifecycle Logic**

* **Employee Lifecycle:**
  Onboarding → Probation → Confirmation → Development → Exit → Offboarding
* **Recruitment Funnel:**
  Requisition Raised → Applicants Screened → Interviewed → Selected → Offered → Joined
* **Attrition:**
  Voluntary vs Involuntary tagged; exit reasons, notice period length, and backfill time tracked
* **Learning Flow:**
  Training planned → Enrolled → Attended → Feedback → Certifications
* **Performance Cycle:**
  Goal Setting → Midyear Review → Final Appraisal → Rating Normalization
* **Payroll:**
  Monthly payroll generation, statutory deductions, bonus processing (Q4/Q1)

---

**3. HR Benchmarks: What Does “Healthy” Look Like?**

* **Attrition Rate:** 10–15% annually (target: <12%)
* **Offer Acceptance Rate:** >85%
* **Time to Hire:** 30–45 days (target: <35 days)
* **Training Hours/Employee/Year:** 25–40 hrs
* **Internal Mobility Rate:** 8–12%
* **Average Tenure:** 3–5 years
* **Diversity Ratios:**
  Gender Diversity: 35–50% female
  New Hires Diversity: 40%+ from underrepresented groups
* **Engagement Score:** 70–85% (from survey)
* **HR Cost per Employee:** \$1.2K–\$2K/year
* **Absenteeism Rate:** <2%
* **Span of Control:** 6–10 direct reports per manager

---

**4. Data Integrity & Quality Patterns**

* **Referential Integrity:** Employee ID linked to every record
* **Orphaned Data:** Avoided; all training, payroll, performance must have employee references
* **Missing Fields:** Optional in surveys and exit interviews; rare in payroll
* **Outliers:**
  Tenure >15 years (legacy employees)
  Training hours >100 (hi-pos or L\&D roles)
* **Anomalies:** Flag multiple low-performance ratings or high absenteeism patterns

---

**5. Volume Estimates:**

* `employees`: 5K–10K
* `recruitment_funnel`: \~2K applications/month (24 months = \~48K records)
* `employee_attrition`: \~80–120 exits/month
* `performance_reviews`: \~10K–15K reviews/year (bi-annual)
* `employee_training`: \~30K records/year (sessions, hours, completion)
* `payroll`: \~5K–10K rows/month
* `employee_engagement`: 2 surveys/year × 70% response × 5K = \~7K entries/year
* `leave_tracker`: 40K+ entries/year
* `headcount_snapshots`: Monthly point-in-time data for headcount, gender mix, avg tenure

---

**Key Assumptions:**

* Global company with multiple geographies
* Role hierarchies: Staff, Manager, Senior Manager, Director, VP
* Surveys anonymized but linked via hashed IDs
* Performance normalized post-calibration
* Training tied to job levels and tenure
