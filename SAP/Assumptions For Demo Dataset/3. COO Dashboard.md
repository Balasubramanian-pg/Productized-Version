Great! Now that we have the data model defined, let's establish the **Business Logic** that will drive the realism and narrative of your CFO demo dataset. This phase is crucial for ensuring the data makes sense to an executive audience.

**Before Any Coding: Business Logic Workshop**

To provide accurate volume estimates and realistic financial patterns, **I need you to confirm the desired `COMPANY_SIZE`** for this demo (Startup, SMB, Enterprise, or Fortune 500). For now, I will use **"Enterprise"** as a default assumption, which typically implies 500-5K employees and 5K-50K customers, impacting the scale of transactions.

---

### **1. Time Dimensions (Default Configuration Confirmed)**

* **Duration:** 2 years historical data (e.g., July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2025).
* **Granularity:** Daily for transactional facts (`fact_gl_postings`, `fact_inventory_movements`, `fact_ar_open_items`, `fact_ap_open_items`). Monthly for aggregated metrics and depreciation (`fact_asset_movements`).
* **Business Calendar:** Standard Monday-Friday for core business operations. Weekends excluded for most transactional activities, but GL postings might occur on weekends for automated processes or month-end.
* **Fiscal Calendar:** Assumed to be **April - March** (standard Indian fiscal year) unless specified otherwise (e.g, October-September).

### **2. Realistic Business Patterns (Seasonality, Growth, Rhythms)**

* **Revenue (Affects `fact_gl_postings`):**
    * **Overall Trend:** Steady year-over-year growth (e.g., 8-12% YoY for an Enterprise).
    * **Seasonality:** Slight dip in Q1, steady growth in Q2-Q3, significant peak in Q4 (e.g., 15-25% higher than average quarter due to year-end deals/renewals).
    * **Monthly Fluctuation:** Generally stable within a quarter, but potential spikes at month-end for invoicing.
* **Expenses (Affects `fact_gl_postings`):**
    * **Operating Expenses:** Largely consistent month-over-month.
    * **Periodic Spikes:** Higher marketing spend in Q2/Q3, annual software license renewals in Q1, and potential bonus payouts in Q4/Q1.
    * **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** Directly proportional to revenue/sales volume, with some lag.
* **Assets (Affects `fact_asset_movements`):**
    * **Acquisitions:** Spaced out periodically, but potentially higher at the beginning or end of the fiscal year for capital expenditure budgeting.
    * **Depreciation:** Consistent monthly postings.
* **Inventory (Affects `fact_inventory_movements` and `dim_materials` stock levels):**
    * **Build-up:** Inventory levels will increase in anticipation of peak sales periods (e.g., Q3 for Q4 sales).
    * **Draw-down:** Inventory levels decrease during and immediately after peak sales.
    * **Regular Flow:** Daily goods issues for sales, weekly/bi-weekly goods receipts from vendors.
* **Accounts Receivable (Affects `fact_ar_open_items`):**
    * **Invoice Volume:** Tied to revenue generation.
    * **Payment Behavior:** Most customers pay within standard terms (e.g., Net 30), but a realistic percentage (e.g., 10-15%) will be slightly late, and a small percentage (e.g., 1-2%) significantly overdue or uncollectible (for bad debt provisions).
* **Accounts Payable (Affects `fact_ap_open_items`):**
    * **Invoice Volume:** Tied to expense and inventory purchases.
    * **Payment Behavior:** Payments typically made just before the due date to optimize cash flow, but some early payment discounts taken.

### **3. Realistic Financial Ratios (KPI Targets)**

These are target values and will be used to guide the random data generation within plausible ranges.

* **EBITDA Margin:** 18-25% of Revenue (reflecting a mature Enterprise).
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** 12-18%.
* **Working Capital Ratio:** 1.3 - 1.8 (Current Assets / Current Liabilities).
* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** 0.6 - 1.2 (for a reasonably leveraged company).
* **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):** 50-70 days.
    * **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO):** 45-55 days.
    * **Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO):** 60-70 days.
    * **Days Payable Outstanding (DPO):** 55-65 days.
* **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR):** > 1.5 (Operating Income / Debt Payments).
* **Return on Assets (ROA):** 6-10%.
* **Inventory Turnover:** 4-6 times per year.
* **Quick Ratio:** 0.9 - 1.2 (Liquid Assets / Current Liabilities).
* **Cash Flow:**
    * **Operating Cash Flow:** Consistently positive, mirroring Net Income after adjustments.
    * **Investing Cash Flow:** Generally negative (for CapEx), with occasional positive spikes for asset sales.
    * **Financing Cash Flow:** Fluctuates based on debt repayment, new borrowings, and dividend payments.

### **4. Data Quality Patterns**

* **Referential Integrity:** Will be strictly maintained across all generated tables to ensure valid relationships for Power BI/Tableau.
* **Null Values:** Minimal, primarily in fields that are optional in real SAP systems (e.g., `clearing_date` for open items, `reference_document`). Less than 1% random nulls in non-critical descriptive fields.
* **Error Patterns:** For a demo, data will be largely "clean" to showcase analytics. No intentional erroneous values or logical inconsistencies will be introduced unless explicitly requested (e.g., for a "data quality issue" demo).
* **Outliers:** Occasional, small number of outlier transactions (e.g., a very large single sale or expense) to add realism without skewing overall metrics excessively.

### **5. Volume Estimates (Assuming "Enterprise" Size - **PLEASE CONFIRM**)**

* **`Dim_Date`:** 730 days (2 years).
* **`Dim_GL_Accounts`:** ~500-1,000 accounts.
* **`Dim_Company_Codes`:** 3-5 company codes.
* **`Dim_Profit_Centers`:** ~50-100 profit centers.
* **`Dim_Cost_Centers`:** ~100-200 cost centers.
* **`Dim_Assets`:** ~2,000-5,000 unique assets.
* **`Dim_Materials`:** ~500-1,500 unique materials/products.
* **`Dim_Customers`:** ~5,000-10,000 customers.
* **`Dim_Vendors`:** ~1,000-2,000 vendors.
* **`Fact_GL_Postings`:** ~5,000-10,000 line items per month (total ~120,000 - 240,000 over 2 years). This will be the largest fact table.
* **`Fact_Asset_Movements`:** ~100-200 depreciation entries per month, plus 10-20 acquisitions/retirements.
* **`Fact_Inventory_Movements`:** ~2,000-5,000 movements per month.
* **`Fact_AR_Open_Items`:** ~1,000-2,000 new items per month.
* **`Fact_AP_Open_Items`:** ~500-1,000 new items per month.

**Next Steps:**

Before I proceed to generate the DBML schema or the Python data generator, please confirm the following:

1.  **`COMPANY_SIZE`**: Is "Enterprise" the correct assumption for data volumes, or do you need a different scale (Startup, SMB, Fortune 500)?
2.  **Fiscal Year Start**: Is January 1st (standard calendar year) suitable for the fiscal calendar, or should it start in a different month?
3.  **Business Logic Adjustments**: Are there any specific modifications or additional patterns you'd like to include for the seasonality, growth, or KPI targets?

Once confirmed, I will proceed to the next phase: generating the Python data generator code and CSV exports.
