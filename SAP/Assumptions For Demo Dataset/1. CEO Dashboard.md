Alright, let me think through this logically from your perspective as someone building a KPI demo:

## Data Generation Logic & Rationale

**Time Periods:**
- **Daily data (Mon-Fri):** Sales orders, billing documents, GL postings, material movements
- **Monthly data:** Employee actions (hires/terminations don't happen daily), survey responses, marketing campaigns
- **Quarterly data:** Some strategic metrics, performance reviews
- **Static/Infrequent:** Master data (customers, materials, employees, GL accounts)

**Business Logic Assumptions:**

**Sales Patterns:**
- Higher sales at month-end (sales teams pushing to close deals)
- Seasonal patterns (Q4 typically stronger, summer slower)
- No sales on weekends but billing can happen (batch processing)
- Sales orders â†’ Billing documents with 5-15 day lag typically

**Financial Posting:**
- Daily GL postings for operational transactions
- Month-end accruals and adjustments
- Revenue recognition aligned with billing
- Cost allocations typically monthly

**HR Patterns:**
- Employee turnover higher at year-end/beginning
- Hiring surges in Q1 and Q3
- No weekend HR transactions

**Volumes (realistic for mid-size company):**
- ~50-100 sales orders/day
- ~30-70 billing documents/day
- ~200-500 GL line items/day
- ~500 employees total
- ~50 customers, ~200 materials

**Data Quality Considerations:**
- Some missing/null values (realistic)
- Currency consistency (mostly USD, some EUR)
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Realistic amounts (not just random numbers)

**Seasonal/Growth Patterns:**
- 5-10% YoY growth trend
- Q4 spike (20-30% higher)
- Summer dip (10-15% lower)
- Marketing spend correlates with sales cycles
