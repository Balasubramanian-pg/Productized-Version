### Business Logic Definition for COO Manufacturing Demo

**Executive Persona:** COO
**Industry:** Manufacturing
**Company Size:** Enterprise (implying a larger scale of operations, multiple plants, higher transaction volumes)
**Historical Data Duration:** 2 years (from current date - July 25, 2025, so from ~July 25, 2023 to July 24, 2025)

**Universal Assumptions:**

* **Date Dimension:**
    * Covers a 2-year historical period, from `2023-07-25` to `2025-07-24`.
    * Daily granularity.
    * `Is_Weekend` correctly flagged.
    * `Is_Holiday` will be simulated for a generic set of national holidays (e.g., New Year's Day, Christmas, etc.) impacting all plants equally, leading to lower or no production on these days.
    * Fiscal Calendar: Assumed to be **Jan-Dec**. If a different fiscal year is needed, please specify (e.g., Oct-Sep).

* **Referential Integrity:** All foreign key relationships defined in the DBML will be strictly maintained. No orphaned records.

* **Data Quality:** Data will be generated to be **clean and consistent** for optimal demo experience. No intentional missing values or inconsistencies, unless specifically requested for a "data quality" scenario.

* **Geographic Distribution:** We will simulate operations across **3 distinct plants** located in different regions (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia) to show geographical performance variations. Each plant will have distinct operational characteristics.

**Entity-Specific Business Logic Assumptions:**

1.  **Dim_Plant:**
    * Generate 3-5 unique `Plant_ID`s (e.g., 'PLNT1', 'PLNT2', 'PLNT3').
    * Assign plausible `Plant_Name`, `City`, `Country`, `Region` (e.g., 'Springfield Mfg', 'Frankfurt Assembly', 'Shanghai Fab').
    * Each plant will have slightly different baseline performance metrics to showcase variations a COO would analyze.

2.  **Dim_Material:**
    * Generate 500-1,000 unique `Material_ID`s.
    * Materials will be categorized into 5-10 `Material_Type`s (e.g., 'Raw Material', 'Semi-Finished Goods', 'Finished Goods', 'Packaging').
    * Assign appropriate `Material_Name`s and `Base_Unit_Of_Measure` (e.g., 'EA', 'KG', 'M', 'LBS').
    * `Product_Hierarchy` will be simple (e.g., 3-4 levels deep).

3.  **Dim_Work_Center:**
    * Generate 20-50 unique `Work_Center_ID`s per plant (total 60-150).
    * Each `Work_Center_ID` is linked to a `Plant_ID`.
    * `Usage` (e.g., '1' for Production).
    * `Capacity_Category` (e.g., 'Machine', 'Labor').
    * `Production_Supervisor_ID` will be linked to `Dim_Employee` (simulated).

4.  **Dim_Equipment:**
    * Generate 5-15 unique `Equipment_ID`s per work center (total 300-1500).
    * Linked to a `Plant_ID`.
    * Plausible `Manufacturer`, `Serial_Number`, `Construction_Year`.
    * `Equipment_Type_Desc` (e.g., 'CNC Machine', 'Assembly Line', 'Injection Molder').

5.  **Dim_Vendor:**
    * Generate 50-100 unique `Vendor_ID`s.
    * Plausible `Vendor_Name`s and `City`/`Country`.

6.  **Dim_Employee:**
    * Generate 500-1000 unique `Employee_ID`s.
    * Assign plausible `Employee_Name`, `Department` (e.g., 'Production', 'Quality', 'Maintenance', 'Logistics'), `Job_Title`, and `Hire_Date`.
    * These employees will be used as `Production_Supervisor_ID`, `Auditor_ID`, `Leader_ID` in fact tables.

**Fact-Specific Business Logic Assumptions (KPI-driven):**

1.  **Fact_Production_Order:**
    * **Volume:** Generate 500-1,000 production orders per day across all plants.
    * **Seasonality:** Peak production volume in Q4 (Oct-Dec) by +15-20% and Q2 (Apr-Jun) by +5-10%. Slight dip in Q3 (Jul-Sep) due to assumed summer slowdown (-5%). No production on weekends/holidays.
    * **Growth:** Overall 5% year-over-year growth in production volume.
    * `Total_Order_Quantity` and `Yield_Quantity` will be generated such that `Yield_Quantity` is typically 95-99% of `Total_Order_Quantity` (i.e., a small inherent loss).
    * `Basic_Start_Date` and `Basic_Finish_Date` will align with production lead times (e.g., 2-5 days for most orders).

2.  **Fact_Production_Operation:**
    * Each `Production_Order` will have 3-7 `Operation_Number`s.
    * `Actual_Start_Date`/`Time` and `Actual_Finish_Date`/`Time` will be generated to occasionally deviate from `Scheduled_Start_Date`/`Time` and `Scheduled_Finish_Date`/`Time` to reflect real-world delays/efficiencies.
    * **On-Time Manufacturing Indicator (OTM):** 85-95% on-time rate, with slight dips corresponding to periods of higher production volume or equipment issues (linked to OEE).

3.  **Fact_OEE:**
    * Calculated daily for each `Equipment_ID`.
    * **Baseline OEE:** Aim for a target of 80-85% overall, with variations.
    * **Availability:** Typically high (90-98%), but with occasional dips (e.g., 1-2 times a month per equipment) for simulated breakdowns/maintenance.
    * **Performance:** Generally 85-95%, showing efficiency against theoretical maximums.
    * **Quality:** Linked to FPY/Rejection Rate from `Fact_Inspection_Result` and `Fact_Inspection_Lot`. If quality is low, `Quality_Percentage` in OEE will reflect this.
    * Individual plant performance will vary (e.g., Plant 1 has slightly higher OEE than Plant 3).

4.  **Fact_Inspection_Lot & Fact_Inspection_Result:**
    * ~20-30% of `Production_Order`s will generate an `Inspection_Lot`.
    * `Los_Size` will correspond to the `Yield_Quantity` of the associated production order.
    * **First Pass Yield (FPY):** Aim for an overall FPY of 92-98%.
        * Minor fluctuations daily.
        * Specific `Material_ID`s or `Work_Center_ID`s may have inherently lower FPY to highlight quality issues (e.g., a specific product line or older machinery).
        * `Rejected_Quantity` will be derived from `Los_Size` and `FPY`. `Rejection_Reason_Code` will be a categorical field (e.g., 'Material Defect', 'Process Error', 'Equipment Malfunction').

5.  **Fact_Manufacturing_Cost:**
    * Populated for each `Production_Order`.
    * `Actual_Costs` will be generated based on a `Standard_Price` for each material and `Total_Order_Quantity`, plus a simulated cost for labor and overhead.
    * **Variance_Amount (DIFF):** Will fluctuate around zero, aiming for a small positive variance (cost savings) 60% of the time, and negative variance (over budget) 40% of the time, representing a healthy but not perfect cost control environment.
    * Higher production volumes might correlate with slight cost efficiencies.

6.  **Fact_Energy_Cost:**
    * Generated daily per `Plant_ID` and a generic "Energy" `Material_ID`.
    * `Energy_Consumption` will correlate with `Production_Volume` and `Equipment_Utilization` (derived from OEE data).
    * `Energy_Cost` will be `Energy_Consumption` multiplied by a simulated `Net_Price` from a `Dim_Vendor`.
    * Consider minor price fluctuations for `Net_Price`.

7.  **Fact_Delivery_Header & Fact_Delivery_Item:**
    * Assume 80-100 `Delivery_Document_ID`s per day, fulfilling `Production_Order`s.
    * Each delivery will have 1-5 `Delivery_Item`s.
    * `Actual_Quantity_Delivered` and `Actual_Quantity_Picked` will match `Total_Order_Quantity` from `Fact_Production_Order` for finished goods.
    * **On-Time In-Full (OTIF):** Aim for 90-97% OTIF.
        * On-Time: `Planned_Goods_Movement_Date` vs. actual delivery date (simulated).
        * In-Full: `Actual_Quantity_Delivered` matches `Actual_Quantity_Picked`.
        * Slight dips in OTIF during peak production periods or periods of higher quality issues.

8.  **Fact_Safety_Incident:**
    * Generate a low, but consistent, number of incidents (e.g., 20-50 per month across all plants).
    * Categorize `Severity_Level` (e.g., 'Low', 'Medium', 'High').
    * Include a small percentage of 'Near Miss' incidents (e.g., 10-20% of all notifications).
    * Associate with a `Plant_ID` and potentially an `Employee_ID`.
    * Random distribution of `Unsafe_Act_Indicator`, `Unsafe_Condition_Indicator`.

9.  **Fact_5S_Score:**
    * Simulate monthly or quarterly audits for each `Work_Center_ID`.
    * Scores (1-5 for each S, Total max 25) will show general improvement over time, but with occasional dips representing areas needing attention.
    * Vary scores slightly by `Plant_ID` and `Work_Center_ID` to indicate areas of excellence and areas for improvement.

10. **Fact_Continuous_Improvement:**
    * Generate 5-10 new projects per quarter across the enterprise.
    * `Project_Type` (e.g., 'KAIZEN', 'OPL', 'Lean Six Sigma').
    * `Status` progression (e.g., 'Planned', 'In Progress', 'Completed', 'On Hold').
    * `Estimated_Savings` will be positive, showing the impact of improvement.
    * `Impact_Level` (e.g., 'Low', 'Medium', 'High').

11. **Fact_Skill_Level:**
    * Assign 3-5 `Skill_ID`s per `Employee_ID` in production/maintenance departments.
    * `Skill_Level` (1-10) will be initially diverse, with some showing improvement over time (simulating training/experience).
    * `Certification_Date` will be generated.

12. **Fact_Emissions, Fact_Water_Usage, Fact_Hazardous_Waste:**
    * Generate daily/monthly data for each `Plant_ID`.
    * **Correlation:** `Emission_Quantity`, `Water_Consumption`, `Waste_Quantity` will generally correlate with `Production_Volume` for each plant, but with some efficiency improvements over time (e.g., slight reduction in consumption per unit produced).
    * Categorize `Emission_Type_Code` (e.g., 'CO2', 'NOx'), `Purpose` for water (e.g., 'Production', 'Cooling'), `Waste_Type_Code` (e.g., 'Chemical', 'Metal Scrap').
    * `Hazard_Level` for waste.
