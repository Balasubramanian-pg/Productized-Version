Here's the **SAP table-level mapping** for your financial metrics, showing where the raw data resides in SAP's database structure:

### **SAP Tables for Financial Metrics**

| Metric Name | Description | Primary SAP Tables | Module | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------------------|--------|-------|
| **EBITDA** | Operating performance before interest/taxes/depreciation | `FAGLFLEXA` (GL Actuals), `ANLC` (Asset Depreciation), `BSEG` (Tax Postings) | FI/AA | Combines P&L and asset data |
| **Return on Equity (ROE)** | Profitability relative to equity | `FAGLFLEXA` (Net Income), `SKAT` (Equity Accounts) | FI | Equity accounts start with '3' in SAP |
| **Working Capital Ratio** | Short-term financial health | `FAGLFLEXA` (Current Assets/Liabilities), `BSIS` (Open Items) | FI | Look for accounts 1xxxx (assets) and 2xxxx (liabilities) |
| **Debt-to-Equity Ratio** | Debt vs equity financing | `FAGLFLEXA` (Liabilities), `SKAT` (Equity Accounts) | FI | Debt accounts typically 2xxxx |
| **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)** | Efficiency of cash flow cycle | `FAGLFLEXA` (Receivables), `MSEG` (Inventory), `BSIK` (Payables) | FI/MM | Requires date fields from documents |
| **Debt Service Coverage** | Ability to service debt | `FAGLFLEXA` (Operating Income), `BSEG` (Debt Payments) | FI | Debt payments often marked with special GL indicators |
| **Return on Assets (ROA)** | Asset efficiency | `FAGLFLEXA` (Net Income), `ANLA` (Asset Values) | FI/AA | Requires asset module integration |
| **Inventory Turnover** | Inventory efficiency | `MSEG` (Goods Movements), `MBEW` (Inventory Valuation) | MM | COGS comes from movement types 261/262 |
| **Quick Ratio** | Immediate liquidity | `FAGLFLEXA` (Liquid Assets), `MARD` (Inventory Values) | FI/MM | Excludes inventory from current assets |
| **Cash Flow** | Cash movements | `FAGLFLEXA` (Operating), `ANLC` (Investing), `BSEG` (Financing) | FI | Requires cash flow statement configuration |

**Key Observations:**
1. **FI-Centric Metrics**: Most metrics rely on `FAGLFLEXA` (New GL) or `BSIS`/`BSEG` (Classic GL)
2. **Asset Metrics**: Require `ANLA`/`ANLC` tables from Asset Accounting
3. **Inventory Metrics**: Depend on MM tables like `MSEG` and `MBEW`
4. **Ratios**: Typically combine data from multiple tables (e.g., `FAGLFLEXA` + `SKAT` for ROE)
