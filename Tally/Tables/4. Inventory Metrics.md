## **Mapping Inventory KPIs to Tally Data Sources**

This dashboard focuses on the health, movement, and value of your stock. The primary sources will be the `Stock Summary`, `Movement Analysis`, and `Ageing Analysis` reports.

#### **1. Inventory Value & Quantity**
- **What it is**: The current total value and quantity of stock, often broken down by type (Raw Material, Finished Goods) or location.
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Stock Summary** Report.
- **Specific Data to Pick**:
    - Go to `Gateway of Tally > Stock Summary`.
    - This report gives you the real-time **Quantity**, **Rate**, and **Value** for every stock item.
    - **For Power BI**: You need to extract this closing balance data. You can also view it by **Stock Group** (e.g., "Raw Materials," "Finished Goods," "Consumables") to get aggregated totals for your dashboard.
- **Verdict**: **Directly available and a core feature of Tally.**

#### **2. Inventory Aging Analysis**
- **What it is**: A breakdown of inventory by how long it has been held. This is critical for identifying obsolete or non-moving stock.
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Ageing Analysis** Report.
- **Specific Data to Pick**:
    - Go to `Gateway of Tally > Display More Reports > Statement of Inventory > Ageing Analysis`.
    - Tally will ask you to define aging slabs (e.g., 0-30 Days, 31-60 Days, 61-90 Days, >90 Days).
    - The report then shows the quantity and value of each stock item within these slabs.
    - **Prerequisite**: This works best if you use **Batches with Manufacturing Dates**. If not, Tally uses the purchase date (FIFO method).
- **Verdict**: **Directly available in Tally.** Power BI is great for visualizing this data as a stacked bar chart.

#### **3. Slow-Moving & Fast-Moving Items**
- **What it is**: Identifying which products are selling/being consumed quickly versus those that are sitting idle.
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Movement Analysis** Report.
- **Specific Data to Pick**:
    - Go to `Gateway of Tally > Display More Reports > Statement of Inventory > Movement Analysis`.
    - Select **Stock Item Analysis**. This report shows the quantity and value of inward and outward movements (purchases, sales, consumption) for each item.
    - Items with high outward movement are **fast-movers**.
    - Items with little to no outward movement are **slow-movers**.
- **Verdict**: **Directly available in Tally.** In Power BI, you can use this data to create an ABC/XYZ analysis or a quadrant chart (e.g., Value vs. Movement).

#### **4. Stock by Location (Godown/Warehouse)**
- **What it is**: Understanding the quantity and value of stock held in different physical locations, warehouses, or even production stages.
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Location / Godown Summary** Report.
- **Specific Data to Pick**:
    - Go to `Gateway of Tally > Display More Reports > Statement of Inventory > Location/Godown`.
    - Select a specific location to see all items stored there, or view an item to see its distribution across all locations.
    - **Prerequisite**: You must enable and consistently use the **Godowns/Locations** feature in Tally for this to work.
- **Verdict**: **Directly available**, provided you have set up and used Godowns.

#### **5. Reorder Status**
- **What it is**: A list of items that have fallen below their pre-defined minimum stock level and need to be reordered.
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Reorder Status** Report.
- **Specific Data to Pick**:
    - Go to `Gateway of Tally > Display More Reports > Statement of Inventory > Reorder Status`.
    - This report lists all items where the current `Closing Stock` is less than the `Reorder Level` defined in the item's master data.
    - It also shows "Nett Available," "Order to be Placed," and the shortfall.
    - **Prerequisite**: You must have meticulously filled in the **"Reorder Level"** and **"Minimum Order Quantity"** fields in each **Stock Item Master**.
- **Verdict**: **Directly available**, but only useful if the master data is maintained.

#### **6. Inventory Turnover & Days Sales of Inventory (DSI)**
- **What it is**: Measures how efficiently inventory is being managed. (Covered in COO dashboard, but essential here too).
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Ratio Analysis**, **P&L A/c**, **Balance Sheet**.
- **Specific Data to Pick**:
    - **Inventory Turnover**: Calculate `Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory`. All components are in the P&L and Balance Sheet.
    - **DSI (Days Sales of Inventory)**: `(Average Inventory / Cost of Goods Sold) * 365`. This converts the turnover ratio into an easily understood "number of days."
- **Verdict**: **Directly available/calculable** from Tally's core financial reports.
