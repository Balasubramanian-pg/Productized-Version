## **Mapping Manufacturing KPIs to Tally Data Sources**

This dashboard focuses on production efficiency, cost control, and quality from an accounting and inventory perspective.

#### **1. Production Volume**
- **What it is**: The quantity of finished goods produced.
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Manufacturing Journal Vouchers** (created via `Vouchers > Other Vouchers (F10) > Stock Journal`).
- **Specific Data to Pick**:
    - You must be using a `Stock Journal` configured as a "Manufacturing Voucher."
    - This voucher has two parts: "Source (Consumption)" and "Destination (Production)."
    - You need the item names and quantities from the **"Destination (Production)"** section.
    - By exporting all manufacturing vouchers, you can sum the quantities of specific finished goods produced over any period.
- **Verdict**: **Directly available in Tally.** This is a fundamental metric that Tally tracks perfectly if the correct voucher type is used.

#### **2. Material Consumption Variance (Standard vs. Actual)**
- **What it is**: The difference between the planned quantity of raw materials (Standard) and the actual quantity used (Actual) to produce goods. This is a critical cost control KPI.
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Bill of Materials (BOM)** and **Manufacturing Journals**.
- **Specific Data to Pick**:
    - **Standard Consumption**: This is defined in the **Bill of Materials (BOM)**. You must create a BOM for each finished good, specifying the exact quantity of each raw material needed.
    - **Actual Consumption**: This is the quantity recorded in the **"Source (Consumption)"** section of the **Manufacturing Journal** for a production run.
- **How to Track**: When you create a manufacturing voucher for an item with a BOM, Tally auto-fills the "Consumption" side with the standard quantities. If your shop floor uses more or less material, the user must manually adjust these quantities in the voucher.
- **In Power BI**: You would compare the BOM quantity against the actual quantity used in the voucher for each production run to calculate the variance (`Actual Qty - Standard Qty`).
- **Verdict**: **Achievable**, but it is **100% dependent on you creating and maintaining accurate Bills of Materials (BOMs)** for your finished goods.

#### **3. Cost of Production**
- **What it is**: The total cost incurred to manufacture a finished good, including materials and additional direct costs.
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Manufacturing Journal Vouchers**.
- **Specific Data to Pick**:
    - Tally automatically calculates the "Effective Cost" of the produced goods. This is based on the valuation method (e.g., weighted average) of the consumed raw materials.
    - **To include other costs (e.g., labor, electricity)**: In the Manufacturing Journal, there is a section called **"Cost of Components."** Below this, you can add **"Additional Costs"** by specifying ledgers like "Factory Wages" or "Manufacturing Overhead" and entering a value or percentage. This amount is then added to the cost of the finished goods.
- **Verdict**: **Directly available in Tally.** Accuracy depends on keeping material costs updated and a disciplined process for adding direct overheads to the manufacturing voucher.

#### **4. Rejection & Scrap Rate**
- **What it is**: The percentage of produced goods that do not meet quality standards.
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Stock Journals** (used for transfer).
- **Explanation**: Tally's manufacturing voucher does not have a "rejected quantity" field. Therefore, you must handle this with a separate process.
- **The Recommended Workflow**:
    1.  **Produce Everything**: In the Manufacturing Journal, record the production of all units (e.g., 100 units of "Product A"). All units are initially considered good and move to the "Finished Goods" location.
    2.  **Record Scrap**: After quality inspection, create a separate **Stock Journal** to move the rejected units.
        - *Source*: "Product A" from "Finished Goods" location (e.g., 5 units).
        - *Destination*: A new stock item called "Scrap - Product A" in a "Scrap Yard" location (e.g., 5 units).
- **How to Track**: In Power BI, your `Scrap Rate %` would be `(Total Quantity transferred to 'Scrap' item) / (Total Quantity Produced in Manufacturing Journal) * 100`.
- **Verdict**: **Possible with a specific workaround.** It requires a strict, two-step process to be tracked accurately.

#### **5. Work-In-Progress (WIP) Value**
- **What it is**: The value of raw materials that have been issued to the production floor but have not yet become finished goods.
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Stock Journals** and a dedicated **WIP Location/Godown**.
- **The Recommended Workflow**:
    1.  **Create a WIP Location**: In Tally, create a new **Godown/Location** called "WIP" or "Shop Floor."
    2.  **Issue Materials to WIP**: When materials are taken from the main store for production, use a **Stock Journal** to transfer them from the "Main Location" to the "WIP Location."
    3.  **Produce from WIP**: In the **Manufacturing Journal**, set the "Consumption" location to "WIP Location" and the "Production" location to "Finished Goods Location."
- **How to Track**: The real-time inventory value of all items in your **"WIP Location"** represents your total WIP value. You can get this from the `Location/Godown Summary` report.
- **Verdict**: **Possible with a specific workaround.** This provides an excellent snapshot of WIP value but requires disciplined use of a dedicated WIP location.

### **Summary Table: Tally Data for Manufacturing Dashboard**

| Manufacturing KPI | Tally Data Location / Report | How to Get It / What to Calculate | Critical Prerequisite in Tally? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Production Volume** | **Manufacturing Journals** | Sum the quantity from the "Destination (Production)" section of all vouchers. | **Yes**, must use Manufacturing Journals. |
| **Consumption Variance** | **Bill of Materials** & **Mfg. Journals** | Compare actual quantity used in the voucher's "Source" section against the standard quantity defined in the BOM. | **Yes**, must use and maintain Bills of Materials (BOMs). |
| **Cost of Production** | **Manufacturing Journals** | Extract the "Effective Cost" from the voucher. Add labor/overheads via the "Additional Costs" feature for accuracy. | No, but adding overheads improves accuracy. |
| **Rejection / Scrap Rate** | **Stock Journals** | A separate journal entry is needed to move goods from "Finished" to a "Scrap" item/location. Rate is `Scrap Qty / Total Produced`. | **Yes**, requires a strict two-step process (Produce then Scrap). |
| **WIP Value** | **Location/Godown Summary** | The total value of all stock in a dedicated "WIP" location. | **Yes**, requires creating and using a WIP location for all transfers. |
