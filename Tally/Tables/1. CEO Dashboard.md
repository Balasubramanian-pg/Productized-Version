### **Mapping CEO KPIs to Tally Data Sources**

For Tally, think in terms of "Reports" as your primary source, which are built from underlying "Ledgers" and "Vouchers".

#### **1. Revenue Growth**
- **What it is**: The increase in sales over a period (e.g., This Quarter vs. Last Quarter, YTD vs. Last YTD).
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Profit & Loss A/c** Report.
- **Specific Data to Pick**:
    - Go to `Gateway of Tally > Display More Reports > Profit & Loss A/c`.
    - The value you need is the total of the **"Sales Accounts"** group, which falls under "Direct Incomes" or "Income (Direct)".
    - To calculate *growth*, you must extract this value for multiple periods (e.g., run the report for Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) and then perform the growth calculation `((Current Period Revenue - Previous Period Revenue) / Previous Period Revenue) * 100` within Power BI.
- **Underlying Tally Data**: This figure is an aggregation of all transactions recorded using the **Sales Voucher (F8)**.

#### **2. Profit Margins (Gross & Net)**
- **What it is**: The profitability of your core business (Gross) and the overall business after all expenses (Net).
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Profit & Loss A/c** Report.
- **Specific Data to Pick**:
    - **Gross Profit**: The Tally P&L report calculates this for you. It is `Sales - Direct Expenses` (which includes Cost of Goods Sold). You can pick this "Gross Profit" line item directly.
    - **Net Profit**: This is also calculated directly in the P&L report. It is `Gross Profit - Indirect Expenses`. Pick the "Net Profit" line item.
    - **Margin Calculation**: In Power BI, you will calculate the margins:
        - `Gross Margin % = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100`
        - `Net Margin % = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100`

#### **3. Customer Metrics (CAC & CLV)**
This is more complex in Tally as it's not a CRM. You'll need to derive these metrics.

- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: `(Total Sales & Marketing Costs) / (Number of New Customers)`
    - **Sales & Marketing Costs**:
        - In your Tally Chart of Accounts, ensure you have a **Ledger Group** under "Indirect Expenses" called "Marketing & Sales Expenses".
        - Place ledgers like "Advertising," "Sales Commissions," "Digital Marketing," etc., under this group.
        - You can then get the total cost from the **P&L A/c** report.
    - **Number of New Customers**:
        - This is difficult to get directly from Tally. You would need to:
            1. Get a list of all customers (Ledgers under the "Sundry Debtors" group).
            2. For each customer, check the date of their *very first sales invoice*.
            3. In Power BI, you could then count how many customers had their first invoice within a specific period (e.g., in the last quarter). This requires pulling detailed voucher-level data for all customers.

- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**:
    - Tally holds the raw data but does not calculate CLV.
    - **Data to Pick**: You need the complete sales history for each customer.
    - **Tally Source**: Go to `Display More Reports > Account Books > Ledger`. Select a customer ledger. You will see all invoices for that customer.
    - **Process**: You must export this transaction-level data for *all* customers (all ledgers under Sundry Debtors) into Power BI and then build the logic to calculate CLV.

#### **4. ROI (Return on Investment) & EPS (Earnings Per Share)**
- **ROI**: `(Net Profit / Total Investment)`
    - **Net Profit**: As mentioned, this comes directly from the **P&L A/c**.
    - **Total Investment**: This depends on what you define as "Investment." If it's Total Capital, you can find this in the **Balance Sheet** report under the **"Capital Account"** group on the Liabilities side.
- **EPS**: `(Net Profit / Number of Outstanding Shares)`
    - **Net Profit**: From the **P&L A/c**.
    - **Number of Outstanding Shares**: **This data is NOT available in Tally**. Tally is an accounting system, not a secretarial or shareholder management system. This number must be sourced externally (e.g., from a spreadsheet managed by the company secretary or finance team) and combined with Tally data in Power BI.

#### **5. Employee Engagement & Turnover**
- **Source**: **This data is NOT available in Tally**.
- Tally's Payroll module handles salary processing and statutory compliance. It does not track metrics like employee satisfaction, engagement scores (NPS), or reasons for leaving.
- **Data to Pick**: You must source this from your **HR Management System (HRMS), external survey tools (like Google Forms, SurveyMonkey), or manual HR records.**

### **Summary Table: Tally Data for CEO Dashboard**

| CEO KPI | Tally Data Location / Report | How to Get It / What to Calculate | External Data Needed? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | **Profit & Loss A/c** | Extract "Sales Accounts" total for multiple periods. Calculate growth in Power BI. | No |
| **Gross Profit Margin** | **Profit & Loss A/c** | Extract "Gross Profit" and "Sales" figures. Calculate margin in Power BI. | No |
| **Net Profit Margin** | **Profit & Loss A/c** | Extract "Net Profit" and "Sales" figures. Calculate margin in Power BI. | No |
| **CAC** | **P&L A/c** & **Ledger Vouchers** | Sum "Marketing" ledgers from P&L. Count "New Customers" by finding the first invoice date for each customer. Very complex. | Potentially, from a CRM for an easier "New Customer" count. |
| **CLV** | **Ledger Vouchers** (Sales) | Export all sales transactions for every customer. Calculate CLV formula in Power BI. | No, but requires heavy transformation. |
| **ROI** | **P&L A/c** & **Balance Sheet** | Get "Net Profit" from P&L. Get "Capital Account" from Balance Sheet. | No |
| **EPS** | **Profit & Loss A/c** | Get "Net Profit" from P&L. | **Yes.** Number of shares must be sourced externally. |
| **Employee Metrics** | Not in Tally | N/A | **Yes.** Must come from HRMS, surveys, or spreadsheets. |

### **How to Connect Power BI to Tally**

1.  **ODBC Connection (Recommended)**: Tally provides an ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) interface. You enable it in Tally, and then in Power BI, you can connect to Tally as an ODBC data source. This allows for scheduled data refreshes.
2.  **Export to Excel/XML**: Manually export the required reports (P&L, Balance Sheet, Ledger Vouchers) from Tally into Excel files. Then, use Power BI to connect to the folder containing these files. This is simpler to set up but is a manual, non-refreshable process.
3.  **Third-Party Connectors**: There are specialized services and connectors built to pull Tally data into Power BI in a more structured way. These can be a good option if the ODBC method proves too complex.
