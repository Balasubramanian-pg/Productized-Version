### **Mapping CFO KPIs to Tally Data Sources**

The **Profit & Loss A/c** and the **Balance Sheet** will be your two most important sources. Tally's `Ratio Analysis` report can also be a helpful shortcut.

#### **1. EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)**
- **What it is**: A measure of overall company profitability, excluding non-operating expenses. Tally does not calculate this directly, so you must build it.
- **Formula**: `Net Profit + Interest Expenses + Taxes + Depreciation`
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Profit & Loss A/c** Report.
- **Specific Data to Pick**:
    - `Gateway of Tally > Display More Reports > Profit & Loss A/c`.
    1.  **Net Profit**: Pick the "Net Profit" line item directly from the report.
    2.  **Interest**: Find the total of all "Interest" ledgers under the "Indirect Expenses" group. Your chart of accounts might have "Interest on Loans," "Bank Interest Paid," etc.
    3.  **Taxes**: Pick the value from the "Provision for Tax" or "Income Tax Expense" ledger.
    4.  **Depreciation**: Pick the value from the "Depreciation" ledger, which is typically under "Indirect Expenses."
- **Action**: You will sum these four components in Power BI to get the final EBITDA figure.

#### **2. ROE (Return on Equity) & ROA (Return on Assets)**
- **What it is**: Measures how efficiently the company is using its equity and assets to generate profit.
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Profit & Loss A/c** and **Balance Sheet**.
- **Specific Data to Pick**:
    - **ROE = Net Profit / Total Equity**
        - **Net Profit**: From the P&L A/c.
        - **Total Equity (Shareholder's Equity)**: From the **Balance Sheet**. This is the sum of the **"Capital Account"** group and the **"Reserves & Surplus"** group.
    - **ROA = Net Profit / Total Assets**
        - **Net Profit**: From the P&L A/c.
        - **Total Assets**: From the **Balance Sheet**. This is the grand total of the "Assets" side of the report.

#### **3. Working Capital & Debt Ratios**
- **What it is**: Measures of liquidity and financial leverage.
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Balance Sheet** and Tally's **Ratio Analysis** report.
- **Specific Data to Pick**:
    - **Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities**
        - Both **"Current Assets"** and **"Current Liabilities"** totals are available directly on the **Balance Sheet**. You just need to subtract one from the other in Power BI.
    - **Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity**
        - **Total Debt**: From the **Balance Sheet**. Sum the totals of the **"Secured Loans"** and **"Unsecured Loans"** groups.
        - **Total Equity**: Calculated as described in the ROE section (Capital + Reserves).
    - **Shortcut**: Go to `Gateway of Tally > Ratio Analysis`. Tally pre-calculates some key ratios like the **Current Ratio** (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) and **Debt-Equity Ratio**. You can use these for verification or direct use.

#### **4. Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)**
- **What it is**: The time it takes for a company to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash. This is an advanced metric requiring several components.
- **Formula**: `DIO (Days Inventory Outstanding) + DSO (Days Sales Outstanding) - DPO (Days Payables Outstanding)`
- **Data to Pick from Tally**:
    - **DIO (for Inventory)**:
        - **Average Inventory**: `(Opening Stock + Closing Stock) / 2`. You get these values from the **Balance Sheet** (for two periods) or **Stock Summary**.
        - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: `Opening Stock + Purchases - Closing Stock`. All items are available in the detailed **P&L A/c**.
    - **DSO (for Receivables)**:
        - **Average Accounts Receivable**: `(Opening Sundry Debtors + Closing Sundry Debtors) / 2`. Get the "Sundry Debtors" total from the **Balance Sheet** for two periods.
        - **Total Credit Sales**: This is best approximated by using the **"Sales Accounts"** total from the **P&L A/c**.
    - **DPO (for Payables)**:
        - **Average Accounts Payable**: `(Opening Sundry Creditors + Closing Sundry Creditors) / 2`. Get the "Sundry Creditors" total from the **Balance Sheet** for two periods.
        - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Use the same COGS calculated for DIO.
- **Action**: All raw components come from Tally's P&L and Balance Sheet. The entire CCC formula must be constructed in Power BI.

#### **5. Cost Metrics (Manufacturing, Energy)**
- **What it is**: A detailed look at specific operational costs.
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Profit & Loss A/c** (specifically, the detailed view).
- **Specific Data to Pick**:
    - This entirely depends on how you have structured your **Chart of Accounts** in Tally.
    - **Manufacturing Costs**: These are your **"Direct Expenses"**. In the P&L, expand this group to see ledgers like:
        - Raw Materials Consumed
        - Factory Wages
        - Power & Fuel (if directly used in production)
        - Other Factory Overheads
    - **Energy Costs**: Look for the **"Power & Fuel"** or **"Electricity Expense"** ledger. It may be under "Direct Expenses" (if for the factory) or "Indirect Expenses" (if for the office). The CFO would be interested in both.
- **Action**: You will need to pull data from these specific ledgers to monitor these costs. A well-organized ledger grouping is critical here.

### **Summary Table: Tally Data for CFO Dashboard**

| CFO KPI | Tally Data Location / Report | How to Get It / What to Calculate | External Data Needed? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **EBITDA** | **Profit & Loss A/c** | Sum `Net Profit + Interest + Tax + Depreciation` ledgers. Calculation done in Power BI. | No |
| **ROE** | **P&L A/c** & **Balance Sheet** | `Net Profit / (Capital + Reserves)`. | No |
| **ROA** | **P&L A/c** & **Balance Sheet** | `Net Profit / Total Assets`. | No |
| **Working Capital** | **Balance Sheet** | `Total Current Assets - Total Current Liabilities`. | No |
| **Debt Ratios** | **Balance Sheet** & **Ratio Analysis** | `(Secured + Unsecured Loans) / (Capital + Reserves)`. | No |
| **Cash Conversion Cycle** | **P&L A/c**, **Balance Sheet**, **Stock Summary** | Complex formula (DIO+DSO-DPO). All raw components are in Tally, but requires heavy calculation in Power BI. | No |
| **Cost Metrics** | **Profit & Loss A/c** (Detailed View) | Pull values from specific ledgers like "Manufacturing Wages," "Power & Fuel," under "Direct Expenses" or "Indirect Expenses." | No (but requires a good chart of accounts). |

### **How to Connect Power BI to Tally**

The method remains the same as for the CEO dashboard:

1.  **ODBC Connection (Recommended)**: Enable Tally's ODBC server and connect Power BI to it for scheduled, automatic data refreshes.
2.  **Export to Excel/XML**: Manually export P&L, Balance Sheet, and other reports to a folder and connect Power BI to that folder. This is manual and less efficient for a CFO's needs.
3.  **Third-Party Connectors**: Use specialized tools that simplify the Tally-to-Power BI data pipeline.
