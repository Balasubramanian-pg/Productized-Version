## **Mapping Logistics KPIs to Tally Data Sources**

This dashboard relies heavily on Tally's order processing cycle (Sales Orders -> Delivery Notes) and how you account for expenses.

#### **1. On-Time Delivery In-Full (OTIF)**
- **What it is**: The percentage of customer orders delivered on the date promised and with the quantity ordered.
- **Primary Tally Source**: Linking **Sales Orders** with their corresponding **Delivery Notes** (or Sales Invoices).
- **Specific Data to Pick**: This requires two comparisons:
    1.  **On-Time (OT)**:
        - **Promised Date**: The `Due On` date entered in the **Sales Order**.
        - **Actual Date**: The `Voucher Date` of the linked **Delivery Note**.
        - *Logic*: `Delivery Note Date <= Sales Order Due On Date`.
    2.  **In-Full (IF)**:
        - **Ordered Quantity**: The `Quantity` of an item in the **Sales Order**.
        - **Delivered Quantity**: The `Quantity` of the same item in the linked **Delivery Note**.
        - *Logic*: `Delivered Quantity = Ordered Quantity`.
- **How to Track**: You need to extract both Sales Order and Delivery Note data. In Power BI, you'll join them (using the order number) and apply the logic above to flag each delivery line as OTIF, On-Time, In-Full, or Late/Short.
- **Verdict**: **Achievable**, but it is **critically dependent** on your team consistently using the full Sales Order -> Delivery Note workflow in Tally.

#### **2. Freight Costs / Unit**
- **What it is**: The average cost to transport one unit of product.
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Profit & Loss A/c** and **Sales Vouchers / Delivery Notes**.
- **Specific Data to Pick**:
    - **Total Freight Cost**: This is the total amount from your **"Freight Outward"** or **"Carriage Outward"** ledger in the **P&L A/c**.
    - **Total Units Shipped**: This is the sum of quantities from all **Delivery Notes** or **Sales Invoices** for the same period.
- **The Challenge & Solution**:
    - **Scenario A (Average Cost - Easy)**: If you just book freight costs as a lump sum expense, you can only calculate a periodic average (`Total Freight for Month / Total Units Shipped in Month`). This is not very insightful.
    - **Scenario B (Cost per Shipment - Better)**: For accurate tracking, you must add the freight expense **directly onto the Sales Invoice** as a separate ledger line item. If you do this, you can link the specific freight cost to the specific units on that invoice.
- **Verdict**: **Possible**, but to be meaningful, it requires the disciplined process of adding freight costs to individual sales invoices. Otherwise, you can only get a general average.

#### **3. MTBF / MTTR (Equipment Reliability)**
- **Mean Time Between Failures / Mean Time To Repair**
- **Primary Tally Source**: **NOT AVAILABLE IN TALLY.**
- **Explanation**: Tally is an accounting and inventory system. It tracks the financial value of your fixed assets (like trucks or forklifts) but has no functionality to log their operational status, uptime, downtime, failure events, or repair times.
- **Where to get the data**: This information must come from an external source:
    - **Spreadsheets**: Maintained by the maintenance or logistics team.
    - **CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System)**: A dedicated software for this.
    - **Manual Logs / Job Cards**.
- **Verdict**: **External data is required.** Tally cannot provide this. You would need to import this data into Power BI separately and merge it if needed.

#### **4. Supply Chain Flexibility**
- **What it is**: A strategic metric. In Tally, we can measure this using a proxy: **Supplier Lead Time**. This shows how quickly you can get materials from your suppliers.
- **Primary Tally Source**: Linking **Purchase Orders** with **Goods Receipt Notes (GRNs)** or **Purchase Invoices**.
- **Specific Data to Pick**:
    - **Order Date**: The `Voucher Date` of the **Purchase Order**.
    - **Receipt Date**: The `Voucher Date` of the linked **GRN** or **Purchase Invoice**.
    - **Lead Time**: `Receipt Date - Order Date`.
- **How to Track**: In Power BI, you can calculate the average lead time for each supplier or raw material. A shorter, more consistent lead time indicates a more reliable and flexible supply chain link.
- **Verdict**: **Achievable**, and a very useful metric. This is the procurement equivalent of OTIF and is possible if you use the Purchase Order -> GRN workflow.

### **Summary Table: Tally Data for Logistics & Transportation Dashboard**

| Logistics KPI | Tally Data Location / Report | How to Get It / What to Calculate | External Data Needed? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **On-Time Delivery (OTIF)** | **Sales Orders** & **Delivery Notes** | Compare `Due On` date and `Quantity` on the SO with the `Voucher Date` and `Quantity` on the DN. | **No**, but requires disciplined use of the order cycle. |
| **Freight Costs / Unit** | **P&L A/c** & **Sales Vouchers** | Calculate `Total Freight Ledger / Total Units Shipped`. For accuracy, freight cost must be added to each sales invoice. | No, but requires a specific accounting process. |
| **MTBF / MTTR** | Not in Tally | N/A | **Yes.** Must come from a CMMS or manual maintenance logs. |
| **Supply Chain Flexibility** (as Supplier Lead Time) | **Purchase Orders** & **GRNs** / **Purchase Invoices** | Calculate the difference between `Voucher Date` of the PO and the `Voucher Date` of the GRN. | **No**, if using the procurement cycle. |
