### **Mapping COO KPIs to Tally Data Sources**

This dashboard requires you to leverage Tally's inventory and manufacturing features. Success here heavily depends on whether you use **Manufacturing Vouchers** and **Sales/Purchase Orders**.

#### **1. Production Volume / Throughput**
- **What it is**: The quantity of finished goods produced in a specific period (day, week, month).
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Manufacturing Journal Vouchers** (or Stock Journals used for production).
- **Specific Data to Pick**:
    - To track production, you must be using a `Stock Journal` voucher class for manufacturing. This voucher records the consumption of raw materials and the production of finished goods.
    - **How to Get the Data**:
        1. Go to `Gateway of Tally > Display More Reports > Statements of Inventory > Job Work Analysis` (if using Job Work) or `Movement Analysis`.
        2. The most direct method for Power BI is to export all **Manufacturing Vouchers**.
        3. In Power BI, filter these vouchers to get only the **"Finished Goods"** items being produced (the destination items).
        4. Sum the `Quantity` column for the desired period.
- **Verdict**: **Directly available in Tally**, provided you use manufacturing vouchers consistently.

#### **2. OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)**
- **What it is**: A measure of manufacturing productivity (`OEE = Availability x Performance x Quality`).
- **Tally's Role**: **Tally cannot calculate OEE on its own.** It is not a Manufacturing Execution System (MES). It lacks the data for Availability and Performance.
- **Breakdown**:
    - **Availability** (`Run Time / Planned Time`): **NOT in Tally**. This data must come from external sources like machine logs or manual operator sheets.
    - **Performance** (`Actual Output / Potential Output`): **NOT in Tally**. This also requires machine-level data (e.g., ideal cycle time) from external sources.
    - **Quality** (`Good Units / Total Units Produced`): **This is the only part Tally *can* help with, if set up correctly.**
        - **Total Units Produced**: This is your "Production Volume" KPI from above.
        - **Good Units**: To find this, you must track rejections. You can do this in Tally by creating a specific **Stock Journal** to move stock from "Finished Goods" to a "Scrap" or "Rejected Goods" location/stock item.
        - `Good Units = Total Units Produced - Rejected Units`.
- **Verdict**: **Mostly external data needed.** Tally can only supply the `Total Units` and potentially the `Rejected Units` to help calculate the "Quality" component. The rest **must** come from spreadsheets, MES, or manual logs.

#### **3. On-Time Manufacturing / Delivery (OTIF)**
This has two parts. "On-Time Delivery" is much easier to track in Tally than "On-Time Manufacturing."

- **On-Time Delivery**:
    - **What it is**: `Actual Delivery Date <= Promised Delivery Date`.
    - **Primary Tally Source**: Linking **Sales Orders** to **Delivery Notes** or **Sales Invoices**.
    - **Specific Data to Pick**:
        1. **Promised Date**: This is the **`Due On`** date you enter in the **Sales Order** voucher.
        2. **Actual Date**: This is the **`Voucher Date`** of the linked **Delivery Note** or **Sales Invoice**.
    - **How to Track**: In Power BI, you'll match the Sales Order to its corresponding Delivery Note/Invoice and compare the two dates. A delivery is "On Time" if `Delivery Note Date <= Sales Order Due On Date`.
    - **Tally Report for reference**: `Display More Reports > Statement of Inventory > Order Outstandings`.

- **On-Time Manufacturing**:
    - **What it is**: `Actual Production Completion Date <= Planned Completion Date`.
    - **Tally's Limitation**: Tally doesn't have a standard "Planned Completion Date" for manufacturing.
    - **Workaround**: Use the **`Due On` date from the Sales Order** as the "Planned Completion Date." Then compare this to the `Voucher Date` of the **Manufacturing Journal** that produced the item for that order. This assumes a make-to-order environment.

- **Verdict**: **On-Time Delivery is achievable** if you use Sales Orders. **On-Time Manufacturing is difficult** and requires using the Sales Order due date as a proxy.

#### **4. Inventory Turnover**
- **What it is**: How many times inventory is sold and replaced over a period.
- **Primary Tally Source**: **Ratio Analysis** Report, **P&L A/c**, and **Balance Sheet**.
- **Specific Data to Pick**:
    - **Method 1 (Easiest)**:
        - Go to `Gateway of Tally > Ratio Analysis`.
        - The **`Inventory Turnover`** ratio is calculated for you. You can extract this directly.
    - **Method 2 (For Power BI Calculation)**:
        - **Formula**: `Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory`.
        - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Get this value from the **Profit & Loss A/c**. It's `Opening Stock + Purchases - Closing Stock`.
        - **Average Inventory**: `(Opening Stock + Closing Stock) / 2`. The stock values are on the P&L and **Balance Sheet**.
- **Verdict**: **Directly available in Tally**. This is a standard financial/inventory metric that Tally handles very well.

### **Summary Table: Tally Data for COO Dashboard**

| COO KPI | Tally Data Location / Report | How to Get It / What to Calculate | External Data Needed? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Production Volume** | **Manufacturing Vouchers** / **Stock Journals** | Export all manufacturing vouchers and sum the quantity of finished goods produced. | **No**, if process is followed. |
| **OEE** | Not available | Tally can only provide `Total Production Qty` and maybe `Rejected Qty` (for Quality %). | **Yes.** Requires machine logs for Availability and Performance metrics. |
| **On-Time Delivery** | **Sales Orders** & **Delivery Notes** / **Sales Invoices** | Compare `Voucher Date` of Delivery Note to the `Due On` date in the linked Sales Order. | **No**, if you use the order processing cycle. |
| **On-Time Mfg.** | **Sales Orders** & **Manufacturing Vouchers** | Compare `Voucher Date` of Manufacturing Journal to the `Due On` date of the linked Sales Order. (This is a workaround). | **No**, but it's an imperfect proxy. |
| **Inventory Turnover** | **Ratio Analysis**, **P&L A/c**, **Balance Sheet** | Extract the pre-calculated ratio from `Ratio Analysis`, or calculate `COGS / Average Inventory` in Power BI. | No |
